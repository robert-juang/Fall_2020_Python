WordPad can format and print text, including fonts, bold, italic,
colored, and centered text, etc., but lacks intermediate features such
as a spell checker, thesaurus, and the creation of tables. However
WordPad can read, render, and save many Rich Text Format (RTF)
features that it cannot create such as tables, strikeout, superscript,
subscript, "extra" colors, text background colors, numbered lists,
right or left indent, quasi-hypertext and URL linking, and various
line spacings. Among its advantages are low system-resource usage,
simplicity, and speed. Pasting into or from an HTML document such as
from the internet or email will typically automatically convert most
or all of it to RTF (although this is partially browser-dependent). As
such, WordPad is well suited for taking notes, writing letters and
stories, or for usage in various tablets, PCs, and smart
phones. However, WordPad is underpowered for work that relies heavily
on graphics or typesetting such as most publishing-industry
requirements for rendering final hard copy.
